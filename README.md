# VueJs_Course_09_Comp_Advanced

These are the files which were used to explanation about some advanced features of components.

This was the last chapter of the course where we learned about components' features and for the next classes we will work with them unhesitatingly.

Also, in these files, were introduced the concepts of slot and component tags, as well as keep-alive, named and standard slots.
